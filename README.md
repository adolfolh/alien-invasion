# ALIEN INVASION  
### An alien invasion game in Python using Pygame. 
  
This was my first attempt at using Pygame. It proved to be a challenge at first, but slowly I started to feel more and more comfortable with it. Likewise, it was the first game I had ever coded (If we don't take into account Scratch games).
